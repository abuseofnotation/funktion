The `maybe` type, also known as `option` type is a container for a value that may not be there. 

The purpose of this monad is to eliminate the need for writing `null` checks. 
Furthermore it also eliminates the possibility of making errors by missing null-checks.

<!--more-->








To use the `maybe` monad constructor, you can require it using node:
		
    var maybe = require("../library/maybe")

Where the `../` is the location of the module.

Then you will be able to wrap a value in `maybe` with:

    var maybe_val = maybe(val)

If the 'val' is equal to *undefined* it threats the container as empty.


You can also combine a `maybe` with an existing monad, using the `maybeT` constructor:

    var maybeT = require("../library/maybeT")
    const maybeList = maybeT(list(1,2,3))




`map(funk)`
----
Executes `funk` with the `maybe`'s value as an argument, but only if the value is different from *undefined*, and wraps the result in a new maybe.

***



Traditionally, if we have a value that may be undefined we do a null check before doing something with it:



	
	var val = get_property(obj)
	
	if(val !== undefined){
		val = val.toString()
	}
	assert.equal(val, undefined) 

With `map` this can be written like this

 	var maybe_get_property = get_property.map(maybe)
	maybe_get_property(obj).map((val) => {

		val.toString()//this is not executed
	})

The biggest benefit we get is that in the first case we can easily forget the null check:
	
	assert.throws(function(){
		get_property(obj).toString()  //this blows up
	})

While in the second case we cannot access the underlying value directly, and therefore cannot execute an action on it, if it is not there.




`phatMap(funk)`
----

Same as `map`, but if `funk` returns a `maybe` it flattens the two `maybes` into one.

***




`map` works fine for eliminating errors, but it does not solve one of the most annoying problems with null-checks - nesting:

	var obj = { first: {second:"val" } }
	
	maybe(obj)
		.map( root => maybe(root.first))
		.map( maybeFirst => maybeFirst.map (first => maybe (maybeFirst.second ) ) ) 
		.map( maybeMaybeValue => maybeMaybeValue.map (maybeValue => maybeValue.map( (value)=>( assert.equal( val, "val") ) ) ) )

`phatMap` does the flattening for us, and allows us to write code like this

	maybe(obj)
		.flatMap(root => maybe(root.first))
		.flatMap(first => maybe(first.second))
		.flatMap(val => {
			assert.equal(val, "val")
		})




Advanced Usage
----



 `maybe` can be used with the function monad to effectively produce 'safe' versions of functions

	var get = f((prop, obj) => obj[prop])
	var maybeGet = get.map(maybe)

This combined with the use of currying makes for a very fluent style of coding:

	var getFirstSecond = (root) => maybe(root).phatMap(maybeGet('first')).phatMap(maybeGet('second'))
	
	getFirstSecond({ first: {second:"value" } }).map((val) => assert.equal(val,"value"))
	getFirstSecond({ first: {second:"other_value" } }).map((val) => assert.equal(val,"other_value"))
	getFirstSecond({ first: "" }).map((val) => assert.equal(val,"whatever") )//won't be executed

Combining with Other Monads
----
In addition to creating a `maybe` from a plain value, you can also create one from an existing monad, using the `maybeT` constructor:

The resulting monad will gain all the characteristics of a `maybe` without losing the characteristics of the underlying monad.

***

    




    var bc = maybeT(list({a:"b"}, {a:"c"})).getProp("a")
    assert.deepEqual(bc._innerMonad, ["b", "c"])
    var abc = bc.lift("reverse").lift("concat", ["a"])
    assert.deepEqual(abc._innerMonad, ["c", "b", "a"])
})


    maybeT(state(1))
    .map()
})





under the hood
--------------
Let's see how the type is implemented







	var maybe = function(value){
                var obj = Object.create(methods)
                obj._value = value
                return Object.freeze(obj)
	}

`map` takes the function and applies it to the value in the maybe, if there is one.





	//m a -> ( a -> b ) -> m b
	methods.map = function map (funk){
		if(this._value !== undefined){
			return this.constructor(funk(this._value))
		}else{	
			return this 
		}
	}

`flat` takes a maybe that contains another maybe and flattens it.
In this case this means just returning the inner value.

	//m (m x) -> m x
	methods.flat = function flat (){
		if(this._value !== undefined){
			return this._value
		}else{
			return this
		}
	}

finally we have `tryFlat` which does the same thing, but checks the types first. The shortcut to `map().tryFlat()` is called `phatMap` 

	methods.tryFlat = function tryFlat (){
		if(this._value !== undefined && this._value.funktionType === "maybe"){
			return this._value
		}else{
			return this
		}
	}
	

Finally, maybe defines one helper function which retrieves the property of an object, wrapped in a maybe:

        methods.getProp = function getProp (prop){
		return this.phatMap( (val) => this.of(val[prop]) )
	}
