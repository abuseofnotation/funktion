The purpose of this monad is to eliminate the need for writing `null` checks. Furthermore it also eliminates the possibility of making errors by missing null-checks.

We often have the following code:

    var val = object[property]
    
    if(val !== undefined){
    	//do something with 'val'
    }

With **maybe** this becomes:

	m.maybe(object[property]).map(function(val){
		//do something with 'val'
	})
In other words `map` is executed only if the value inside the maybe is different from *undefined*.

This is the key thing in eliminating  errors. If you have access to a value that may be undefined you can easily forget to null-check it.

	var val = object[property](object)
	val.foo()//Blows up if val is undefined    
    
If you use **maybe** you cannot access the underlying value directly, and therefore you cannot execute an action on it, if it is not there.
 
	m.maybe(object[property]).map(function(val){
		val.foo()//Code does not get called.
	})
