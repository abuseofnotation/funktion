A container for a value that may or not be there. 

`var m = f.maybe(value)`:  Creates a new `maybe`. 
If the value is equal to *undefined* it threats the container as empty.

`m.map(funk)`: Executes the function with the `maybe`'s value as an argument, but only if the value is different from *undefined*.

`m.mjoin()`: If the value of the `maybe` is another maybe, this function flattens the two maybes, by setting the value of the external one, as the value of the internal. 

`m.chain(funk)`: Takes a function that accepts a value and returns another `maybe` and applies it to the current one (Equivalent to `m.map(funk).mjoin()`).

The purpose of this monad is to eliminate the need for writing `null` checks. Furthermore it also eliminates the possibility of making errors by missing null-checks.

We often have the following code:

    var val = object[property]
    
    if(val !== undefined){
    	//do something with 'val'
    }

With **maybe** this becomes:

	m.maybe(object[property]).map(function(val){
		//do something with 'val'
	})
In other words `map` is executed only if the value inside the maybe is different from *undefined*.

This is the key thing in eliminating  errors. If you have access to a value that may be undefined you can easily forget to null-check it.

	var val = object[property](object)
	val.foo()//Blows up if val is undefined    
    
If you use **maybe** you cannot access the underlying value directly, and therefore you cannot execute an action on it, if it is not there.
 
	m.maybe(object[property]).map(function(val){
		val.foo()//Code does not get called.
	})
